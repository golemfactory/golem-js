/**
 * Whitelist Outbound Internet Access Example
 *
 * This example presents how you can leverage the whitelist outbound rule.
 *
 * Few things to keep in mind:
 *
 * - your Requestor script has to present a manifest (manifest.json) as part of the demand when negotiating
 *   with Providers
 * - the Providers need to have the URL which you're trying to reach on their whitelist, if the address
 *   which you're using is not on the pre-installed one (which the providers can clear if they want to)
 *   then you need to reach out to the Provider community (you can use Golem Network's Discord) and
 *   request opening some URL by them for you :
 *
 * @link https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-installer-resources/tree/main/whitelist Pre-installed whitelist
 *
 * This example reaches out to the whitelisted registry.npmjs.org to download golem-js release information
 *
 * WORKING WITH THE MANIFEST
 *
 * `@golem-sdk/cli` to the rescue - check the `manifest` sub-command to generate the manifest for your
 * requestor and maintain the outbound configuration
 *
