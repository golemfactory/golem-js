## What's Golem and `golem-js`?

**[The Golem Network](https://golem.network)** fosters a global group of creators building ambitious software solutions
that will shape the technological landscape of future generations by accessing computing resources across the platform.
Golem Network is an accessible, reliable, open access and censorship-resistant protocol, democratizing access to digital
resources and connecting users through a flexible, open-source platform.

**@golem-sdk/golem-js** is the JavaScript API that allows developers to connect to their Golem nodes and manage their
distributed, computational loads through Golem Network.

## Golem application development

For a detailed introduction to using Golem and `@golem-sdk/golem-js` to run your tasks on
Golem [please consult our quickstart section](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/javascript/quickstarts).

### Installation

`@golem-sdk/golem-js` is available as a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@golem-sdk/golem-js).

You can install it through `npm`:

```bash
npm install @golem-sdk/golem-js
```

or by `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @golem-sdk/golem-js
```

### Building

To build a library available to the NodeJS environment:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate production code in the `dist/` directory ready to be used in your nodejs or browser applications.

### Usage

Hello World

```javascript
import { TaskExecutor } from "@golem-sdk/golem-js";

(async function main() {
  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create("9a3b5d67b0b27746283cb5f287c13eab1beaa12d92a9f536b747c7ae");
  await executor.run(async (ctx) => console.log(await ctx.run("echo 'Hello World'")).stdout);
  await executor.end();
})();
```

#### Node.js context

#### Web Browser context

For more detailed usage examples and tutorials, see
the [Java Script API section of the Golem Network Docs](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/javascript)

### Testing

### Running unit tests

To run unit tests, you can simply execute the command:

```bash
npm run test:unit
# or
yarn test:unit
```

### Running E2E tests

Both test cases for the NodeJS environment and the browser (cypress) require preparation of a test environment of the
Golem Network with Providers and all the necessary infrastructure.

#### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed in your system.
2. Your Linux environment should have nested virtualization enabled.

#### Test Environment Preparation

Follow these steps to prepare your test environment:

##### Build Docker Containers

First, build the Docker containers using the `docker-compose.yml` file located under `tests/docker`.

Execute this command to build the Docker containers:

    docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml build

##### Start Docker Containers

Then, launch the Docker containers you've just built using the same `docker-compose.yml` file.

Execute this command to start the Docker containers:

    docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml down && docker-compose -f tests/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

##### Fund the Requestor

The next step is to fund the requestor.

    docker exec -t docker_requestor_1 /bin/sh -c "/golem-js/tests/docker/fundRequestor.sh"

##### Install and Build the SDK

Finally, install and build the golem-js SDK in the Docker container

Run this chain of commands to install and build the SDK and prepare cypress.

```docker
docker exec -t docker_requestor_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /golem-js && npm i && npm run build && ./node_modules/.bin/cypress install"
```

#### Execute the E2E Tests

With your test environment set up, you can now initiate the E2E tests. Run the following command to start:

```docker
docker exec -t docker_requestor_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /golem-js && npm run test:e2e"
```

#### Execute the cypress Tests

First make sure that the webserver that's used for testing is running, by running the command

```docker
docker exec -t -d docker_requestor_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /golem-js/examples/web && node app.mjs"
```

Now you're ready to start the cypress tests by running the command

```docker
docker exec -t docker_requestor_1 /bin/sh -c "cd /golem-js && npm run test:cypress -- --browser chromium"
```

### Contributing

It is recommended to run unit tests and static code analysis before committing changes.

```bash
yarn lint
# and
yarn format
```

## Controlling interactions and costs

The Golem Network provides an open marketplace where anyone can join as a Provider and supply the network with their
computing power. In return for their service, they are billing Requestors (users of this SDK) according to the pricing
that they define. As a Requestor, you might want to:

- control the limit price so that you're not going to over-spend your funds
- control the interactions with the providers if you have a list of the ones which you like or the ones which you would
  like to avoid

To make this easy, we provided you with a set of predefined market proposal filters, which you can combine to implement
your own market strategy.

### Limit price limits to filter out offers that are too expensive

```typescript
import { TaskExecutor, ProposalFilters } from "@golem-sdk/golem-js";

const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
  // What do you want to run
  package: "golem/alpine:3.18.2",

  // How much you wish to spend
  budget: 0.5,
  proposalFilter: ProposalFilters.limitPriceFilter({
    start: 1,
    cpuPerSec: 1 / 3600,
    envPerSec: 1 / 3600,
  }),

  // Where you want to spend
  payment: {
    network: "polygon",
  },
});
```

To learn more about other filters, please check the [API reference of the market/strategy module](https://docs.golem.network/docs/golem-js/reference/modules/market_strategy)

### Work with reliable providers

The `getHealthyProvidersWhiteList` helper will provide you with a list of Provider ID's that were checked with basic health-checks. Using this whitelist will increase the chance of working with a reliable provider. Please note, that you can also build up your own list of favourite providers and use it in a similar fashion.

```typescript
import { TaskExecutor, ProposalFilters, MarketHelpers } from "@golem-sdk/golem-js";

// Prepare the price filter
const acceptablePrice = ProposalFilters.limitPriceFilter({
  start: 1,
  cpuPerSec: 1 / 3600,
  envPerSec: 1 / 3600,
});

// Collect the whitelist
const verifiedProviders = await MarketHelpers.getHealthyProvidersWhiteList();

// Prepare the whitelist filter
const whiteList = ProposalFilters.whiteListProposalIdsFilter(verifiedProviders);

const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
  // What do you want to run
  package: "golem/alpine:3.18.2",

  // How much you wish to spend
  budget: 0.5,
  proposalFilter: async (proposal) => (await acceptablePrice(proposal)) && (await whiteList(proposal)),

  // Where you want to spend
  payment: {
    network: "polygon",
  },
});
```
