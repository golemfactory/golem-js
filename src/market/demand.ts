   * The value of this field is used to define how long the demand is valid for yagna to match against.
   * In addition, it will determine how long the resulting activity will be active.
   *
   * For example: if `expirationSec` is set to 10 minutes, the demand was created and starting an activity
   * required 2 minutes, this means that the activity will be running for 8 more minutes, and then will get terminated.
   *
   * **IMPORTANT**
   *
   * It is possible that a provider will reject engaging with that demand if it's configured  without using a deadline.
   *
   * **GUIDE**
   *
   * If your activity is about to operate for 5-30 min, {@link expirationSec} is sufficient.
   *
   * If your activity is about to operate for 30min-10h, {@link debitNotesAcceptanceTimeoutSec} should be set as well.
   *
   * If your activity is about to operate longer than 10h, you need set both {@link debitNotesAcceptanceTimeoutSec} and {@link midAgreementPaymentTimeoutSec}.
