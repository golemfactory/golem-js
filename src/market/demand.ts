   * required 2 minutes, this means that the activity will be running for 8 more minutes, and then will get terminated.

   * **IMPORTANT**
   *
   * It is possible that a provider will reject engaging with that demand if it's configured  without using a deadline.
   *
   * **GUIDE**
   *
   * If your activity is about to operate for 5-30 min, {@link expirationSec} is sufficient.
   *
   * If your activity is about to operate for 30min-10h, {@link debitNotesAcceptanceTimeoutSec} should be set as well.

   * If your activity is about to operate longer than 10h, you need set both {@link debitNotesAcceptanceTimeoutSec} and {@link midAgreementPaymentTimeoutSec}.
